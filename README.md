# Project Overview: 
Banking System:
The "Banking System" project is a simple yet comprehensive simulation of a banking system that allows users to perform essential banking operations such as creating accounts, depositing and withdrawing funds, transferring money between accounts, and checking account balances. The application is console-based and built using Java, making it a great project for demonstrating fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Java.
<br>
# Project Objective
The main objective of the Banking System project is to create a user-friendly application that simulates basic banking functionalities. The project aims to provide a hands-on understanding of OOP principles such as encapsulation, abstraction, and the use of Java Collections for managing data. The project is designed to be both educational and practical, serving as a foundation for more complex financial applications.

# Key Activities
<br>
✅Account Management:
<br>
Users can open new bank accounts by providing an account number and account holder's name.
<br>
The system ensures no duplicate accounts by checking for existing account numbers.
<br>
✅Depositing Funds:
<br>
Users can deposit money into their accounts.
<br>
The system validates the deposit amount to ensure it is positive.
<br>
✅Withdrawing Funds:
<br>
Users can withdraw money from their accounts.
<br>
The system checks for sufficient balance before processing the withdrawal.
<br>
✅Transferring Funds:
<br>
Users can transfer money between accounts.
<br>
The system ensures the transfer amount is valid and that both the source and target accounts exist.
<br>
✅Balance Inquiry:
<br>
Users can check the balance of their accounts at any time.
<br>
The system retrieves and displays the current balance of the selected account.
<br>
✅Menu-Driven Interface:
<br>
The system presents users with a menu to choose different banking operations.
<br>
The application loops until the user chooses to exit.
<br>
# Technologies Used
<br>
Java Programming Language: The entire application is written in Java, utilizing its robust features for object-oriented programming and data handling.
<br>
Java Collections Framework: A HashMap is used to store and manage bank accounts, providing efficient access and manipulation of account data.
<br>
Java I/O: The Scanner class is used for reading user input from the console.
<br>
Object-Oriented Principles: The project heavily employs OOP concepts such as encapsulation (e.g., using private fields and public methods in the Account class), abstraction (e.g., simplifying account operations), and static members (e.g., using a static HashMap to manage accounts).
